\# VR World Immigration Simulator



\## Story / Concept

In this simulator, the user experiences the impact of immigration policies in a virtual world.  

By adjusting policy sliders such as \*\*tax rate\*\*, \*\*immigration openness\*\*, and \*\*border strictness\*\*, the user can observe how changes affect \*\*population\*\*, \*\*economy\*\*, and \*\*happiness\*\* in real-time.



The goal is to \*\*educate users about policy consequences\*\* in a safe, interactive environment. Users can experiment with different scenarios and see how small policy adjustments ripple through society.  



This project emphasizes \*\*full-stack VR interaction\*\*:

\- \*\*Frontend:\*\* A-Frame VR scene with interactive 2D panels  

\- \*\*Backend:\*\* Node.js server that runs the simulation logic  

\- \*\*Database:\*\* Firebase Firestore stores the simulation state in real-time



\## Educational / Experiential Goals

\- Demonstrate the cause-effect relationship of immigration policies  

\- Provide an interactive learning environment  

\- Allow users to explore policy scenarios safely
